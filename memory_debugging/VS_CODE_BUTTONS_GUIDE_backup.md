- **What it does**: Analyze existing memory debug logs
- **Shows**: Memory patterns, leak detection, statistics
- **Best for**: Post-analysis of collected data

### 📈 **Live Memory Analysis**
- **What it does**: Real-time memory monitoring and analysis
- **Shows**: Live memory usage, trends, alerts
- **Best for**: Watching memory usage in real-time

## 📋 **Log Management Buttons**

### 🔍 **Tail Memory Debug Log**
- **What it does**: Real-time view of memory debug log (like tail -f)
- **Shows**: Live streaming log entries as they're written
- **Best for**: Watching memory data collection in real-time and reviewing complete history

### 🧹 **Clear Memory Log**
- **What it does**: Clear the memory debug log file

### 📂 **List Memory Backups**
- **What it does**: Show all available backup files
- **Shows**: Backup files with timestamps and sizes
- **Best for**: Finding the right backup to restore

## 🎯 **Recommended Workflow**

### **For Memory Leak Investigation:**
1. **🧹** Clear Memory Log (start fresh)
2. **📈** Live Memory Analysis (start monitoring)
3. **Use your app normally** for 10-30 minutes
4. **🔬** Memory Leak Analyzer (analyze collected data)
5. **📈** Live Memory Analysis (if needed)

### **For Quick Memory Check:**

2. **�** View Memory Log (review results)
3. **�** Memory Leak Analyzer (if issues found)

### **For Continuous Monitoring:**
1. **🔍** External Monitor (30min) - Standard monitoring
2. **📈** Live Memory Analysis (real-time)
3. **🔍⏱️** Extended Monitor (1hour) - Deep analysis

## 🎨 **Button Colors**

- **🟢 Green (Success)**: Safe resilient operations
- **🔵 Blue (Info)**: Analysis and monitoring tools  
- **🟡 Yellow (Warning)**: Manual operations that need caution
