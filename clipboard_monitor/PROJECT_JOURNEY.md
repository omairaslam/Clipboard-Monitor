#### 9.3 Enhanced Notification System
- **Problem**: Inconsistent notification delivery and potential security vulnerabilities
- **Challenge**: macOS notification system requires proper thread handling and security
- **Solution**: Dual notification architecture with security hardening
- **Implementation**:
  - Primary AppleScript integration for direct macOS notification access
  - Fallback rumps notification system for compatibility
  - Input sanitization to prevent AppleScript injection
  - Timeout protection and error logging

#### 9.4 Notification Security & Reliability
```python
def show_mac_notification(self, title, subtitle, message):
    # Escape quotes to prevent AppleScript injection
    title = title.replace('"', '\\"')
    subtitle = subtitle.replace('"', '\\"')
    message = message.replace('"', '\\"')

    # Use AppleScript for reliable notifications
    script = f'display notification "{message}" with title "{title}" subtitle "{subtitle}"'
    subprocess.run(["osascript", "-e", script], check=True)

    # Log notification for debugging
    with open(self.log_path, 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"Notification sent: {title} - {subtitle} - {message}\n")
```
