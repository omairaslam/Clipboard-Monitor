# DMG List View and Install Script Improvements

## 🎯 **Enhancements Implemented**
✅ **Removed separate LaunchAgents folder opening** - Script now only opens DMG
✅ **Changed DMG layout to list view** - Better file visibility and organization
✅ **Updated user messages** - Reflects new symlink-based workflow
✅ **Streamlined installation process** - Single window, cleaner experience

## 🔄 **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Install.sh Script Modifications**

#### **Before:**
```bash
# Opened both DMG and LaunchAgents folders
open "/Volumes/Clipboard Monitor"
open "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents"

echo "✨ Perfect! Both folders are now open."
echo "📋 Now just drag these 2 files from the DMG to LaunchAgents:"
```

#### **After:**
```bash
# Only opens DMG
open "/Volumes/Clipboard Monitor"

echo "✨ Perfect! DMG is now open in list view."
echo "📋 Simply drag both plist files onto the LaunchAgents symlink:"
echo "💡 The LaunchAgents symlink will copy the files to the correct location!"
```

### **2. DMG Layout Changes**

#### **Before: Icon View**
- 700×450 window with positioned icons
- Complex 3-column layout with specific coordinates
- Icon size: 56px with manual positioning
- Required precise positioning for each item

#### **After: List View**
- 500×400 window with list layout
- Clean list view showing all files clearly
- Small icons with text labels
- Automatic alphabetical sorting
- No manual positioning required

### **3. User Message Updates**

#### **Installation Instructions:**
```
🚀 SUPER SIMPLE INSTALLATION:
   1. I'll open the DMG in list view for easy access
   2. Just drag both plist files onto the LaunchAgents symlink
   3. Come back here and press any key to continue
```

#### **Success Messages:**
```
✅ Opened DMG in list view
📋 Simply drag both plist files onto the LaunchAgents symlink:
   • com.clipboardmonitor.plist → LaunchAgents
   • com.clipboardmonitor.menubar.plist → LaunchAgents
💡 The LaunchAgents symlink will copy the files to the correct location!
```

## 🎨 **AppleScript Configuration**

### **List View Settings:**
```applescript
tell application "Finder"
    tell disk "$VOLUME_NAME"
        open
        set current view of container window to list view
        set toolbar visible of container window to false
        set statusbar visible of container window to false
        set the bounds of container window to {400, 100, 900, 500}
        
        -- Configure basic list view options
        set viewOptions to the list view options of container window
        set text size of viewOptions to 12
        set icon size of viewOptions to small icon
        set calculates folder sizes of viewOptions to false
    end tell
end tell
```
