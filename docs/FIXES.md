# Clipboard Monitor - Bug Fixes and Improvements

This document provides a detailed analysis of bugs identified and fixed in the clipboard monitor application, along with comprehensive explanations of the implemented solutions.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Unused Import (Minor)**
- **Issue**: `NSRunLoop` was imported in `main.py` but never used in the code, creating unnecessary dependencies.
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed the unused import from `main.py`
  - Conducted a full codebase scan to identify and remove other unused imports
  - Added import organization to maintain clean dependencies

### 2. **Race Condition in Markdown Module**
- **Issue**: The markdown module modified the clipboard twice in quick succession (first setting RTF content, then attempting to restore original content), causing potential race conditions with event-driven monitoring. This resulted in unpredictable behavior where:
  1. The first modification triggered a clipboard change event
  2. Before the second modification completed, the event handler processed the intermediate state
  3. This led to incorrect content processing and potential infinite loops
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed the clipboard restoration to avoid race conditions
  - Added content tracking with SHA-256 hashing to prevent reprocessing the same content
  - Implemented thread-safe processing with locks to prevent concurrent modifications
  - Added a cooldown period after processing to allow events to settle

### 3. **Infinite Processing Loop**
- **Issue**: When a module modified the clipboard, it triggered another clipboard change event, causing an infinite loop of processing. This resulted in:
  1. High CPU usage
  2. Rapid succession of notifications
  3. Potential system instability
  4. Battery drain on laptops
- **Fix**: 
  - Implemented `ContentTracker` class to track recently processed content using:
    - SHA-256 hashing for content identification
    - LRU (Least Recently Used) cache for efficient storage
    - Configurable history size to prevent memory bloat
  - Added timestamp-based cooldown periods between processing attempts
  - Implemented detection and breaking of circular processing patterns
  - Added monitoring for rapid succession events with automatic circuit breaking

### 4. **Missing Error Handling in Subprocess Calls**
- **Issue**: Subprocess calls (particularly to `pandoc` and `textutil`) had no timeout or error handling, leading to:
  1. Potential hanging of the application when subprocesses stalled
  2. Silent failures when subprocesses returned errors
  3. No feedback to users when tools were missing
  4. Potential resource leaks from zombie processes
- **Fix**: 
  - Added timeout to all subprocess calls (default: 15 seconds, configurable)
  - Implemented proper error handling with specific exception types
  - Created comprehensive logging of subprocess stdout/stderr
  - Developed `safe_subprocess_run` utility function with:
    - Timeout handling
    - Error capturing and formatting
    - Resource cleanup
    - Proper encoding handling
  - Added subprocess result validation before processing

### 5. **Inconsistent Notification Function**
- **Issue**: The notification function had no error handling and used different implementations across modules, leading to:
  1. Potential script injection vulnerabilities in AppleScript
  2. Silent failures when notifications couldn't be displayed
  3. Inconsistent user experience across different modules
  4. No fallback mechanism when AppleScript failed
- **Fix**: 
  - Created a unified notification function in `utils.py`
  - Added comprehensive try-except block to catch AppleScript errors
  - Implemented timeout to prevent hanging (5 seconds)
  - Added input validation and sanitization to prevent AppleScript injection
  - Created a fallback mechanism using `print` when AppleScript fails
  - Added notification throttling to prevent overwhelming the user

### 6. **Module Loading Errors**
- **Issue**: Module loading failed silently with cryptic errors, making it difficult to:
  1. Identify which modules failed to load
  2. Understand why modules failed
  3. Fix module issues
  4. Verify module compatibility
- **Fix**: 
  - Added detailed error messages for module loading failures
  - Implemented validation for module interface with specific checks
  - Created proper exception handling during import with:
    - ModuleNotFoundError handling

    - AttributeError handling
    - General exception handling
  - Added module dependency checking
  - Implemented graceful degradation when modules fail to load
  - Created a module validation test utility

### 7. **Duplicate Notification Function**
- **Issue**: Both `main.py` and `markdown_module.py` had identical `show_notification` functions, leading to:
  1. Code duplication and maintenance challenges
  2. Inconsistent behavior when one version was updated but not the other
  3. Different error handling approaches
  4. Potential security vulnerabilities in one implementation
- **Fix**: 
  - Created shared `utils.py` module with common utilities

    - Comprehensive error handling
    - Security features (AppleScript injection prevention)
    - Timeout handling
    - Fallback mechanisms
  - Removed duplicate functions from all modules
  - Updated all module imports to use the shared utility

### 8. **Missing Module Interface Validation**
- **Issue**: Code assumed all modules had `process` function without validation, leading to:
  1. Cryptic errors when modules lacked the required interface
  2. Potential crashes when calling non-existent functions
  3. Difficult debugging for module developers
  4. Inconsistent error handling across modules
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `_validate_module()` function to check module interface

    - Signal handling
    - Thread joining
    - Resource cleanup
  - Implemented event-based communication between threads
  - Added adaptive polling intervals based on system load

### 11. **Inappropriate Clipboard Modification Issues**
- **Issue**: Code formatter module was automatically modifying clipboard content without user consent, leading to:
  1. Unexpected changes to user's copied code
  2. Loss of original formatting preferences

    "max_content_length": 10000,              // Maximum content length to store
    "save_location": "~/Library/Application Support/ClipboardMonitor/clipboard_history.json"
  },
  "security": {
    "sanitize_clipboard": true,               // Enable content sanitization
    "max_clipboard_size": 10485760            // Maximum clipboard size (10MB)
  }
}
```


## Dependencies

No new dependencies were added. All improvements use existing libraries and Python standard library features:

- `pyperclip`: Cross-platform clipboard access
- `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa`: macOS integration for enhanced clipboard monitoring
- `rumps`: Menu bar application support

**Note:** The Rich library has been removed. All logging is now plain text with timestamps and log levels using Python's standard logging module.

## Installation

The installation process has been simplified with the `install_dependencies.sh` script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clipboard-monitor.git
cd clipboard_monitor

# Install dependencies
./install_dependencies.sh

# Configure the LaunchAgent
# (Update paths in com.omairaslam.clipboardmonitor.plist)

# Install the LaunchAgent
cp com.omairaslam.clipboardmonitor.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.omairaslam.clipboardmonitor.plist
```

## Known Issues

### RTF Content History Display
- **Issue**: When Markdown is converted to RTF, the RTF content is correctly copied to the system clipboard and appears in other clipboard managers and when pasted into documents. However, the RTF content does not appear as an additional entry in this application's clipboard history (menu bar, CLI viewer, or web viewer).
- **Impact**: Users can successfully use the RTF content by pasting it, but cannot see it in the application's history viewers.
- **Workaround**: The original Markdown content remains visible in history, and the RTF conversion is successful for pasting purposes.
- **Status**: Under investigation - multiple attempts to fix this issue have not resolved the underlying clipboard monitoring limitation.
