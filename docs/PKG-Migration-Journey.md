# From DMG to PKG: A Development Journey

## Executive Summary

This document chronicles the migration from DMG-based distribution to PKG-based distribution for the Clipboard Monitor application, detailing the technical challenges, solutions, and advantages gained through this transition.

## The Problem: DMG Limitations

### Initial DMG Approach
Our initial distribution strategy used DMG (Disk Image) files, which seemed like the standard macOS approach. However, we quickly encountered significant limitations:

### Critical Issues with DMG Distribution

#### 1. **LaunchAgent Installation Problem**
- **Issue**: DMG files are read-only mounted volumes
- **Impact**: Cannot directly install LaunchAgent plist files to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- **User Experience**: Required manual steps or complex workarounds

#### 2. **Manual Installation Steps**
```bash
# Users had to manually:
1. Mount the DMG
2. Drag app to Applications
3. Manually copy plist files (if provided)
4. Run launchctl commands manually
5. Deal with permission issues
```

#### 3. **Plist File Management Nightmare**
- **Template Problem**: Plist files contained hardcoded paths that didn't match PyInstaller bundle structure
- **Path Mismatch**: Development paths vs. production bundle paths were different
- **Manual Updates**: Users had to manually edit plist files or run additional scripts

#### 4. **Security and Permission Issues**
- **Gatekeeper Problems**: Unsigned DMG contents triggered security warnings
- **User Confusion**: Multiple security dialogs and manual overrides required
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Different behavior across macOS versions

## The Solution: PKG Migration

### Why PKG?

#### 1. **Native System Integration**
- PKG files are macOS's native installer format
- Built-in support for system-level installations
- Proper integration with macOS security model

#### 2. **Automated LaunchAgent Installation**
- **Pre/Post Install Scripts**: Can execute system commands with proper privileges
- **Automatic Plist Installation**: Direct installation to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- **Service Startup**: Automatic service registration and startup

#### 3. **Template Processing**
- **Dynamic Path Updates**: Plist templates updated during build process
- **PyInstaller Integration**: Paths automatically adjusted for bundled executables
- **No Manual Editing**: Users get ready-to-use configuration files
