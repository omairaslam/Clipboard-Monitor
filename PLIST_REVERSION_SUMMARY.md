# Plist Installation Reversion Summary

## Issue
SentinelOne security software is detecting automated plist file creation as a threat, requiring a reversion to the manual installation approach.

## ‚úÖ **Changes Made - Reverted to Manual Approach**

### **1. `install.sh` - Reverted to Manual Plist Installation**

#### **Commented Out Automated Creation:**
- Background service plist creation (lines 361-382)
- Menu bar service plist creation (lines 391-418)
- Added comments explaining SentinelOne detection issue

#### **Restored Manual Installation Prompts:**
- Added manual plist installation section (lines 421-437)
- Clear instructions for users to copy plist files from DMG
- User prompt to wait for manual copying before continuing
- Informative messages about SentinelOne security software

### **2. `create_dmg_fixed.sh` - Restored Plist Files in DMG**

#### **Added Plist File Copying:**
- Copies `com.clipboardmonitor.plist` from `plist_files/` directory
- Copies `com.clipboardmonitor.menubar.plist` from `plist_files/` directory
- Files are included in DMG root for easy user access

#### **Updated README Content:**
- Restored manual installation step in instructions
- Added note about SentinelOne security software requirement
- Clear step-by-step process for users

#### **Restored Verification Checks:**
- KeepAlive verification in app bundle before DMG creation
- KeepAlive verification in mounted DMG after creation
- Ensures critical fix is properly applied

### **3. `create_dmg.sh` - Updated Main DMG Script**

#### **Added Plist File Support:**
- Copies plist files to DMG during creation
- Updated README with manual installation instructions
- Consistent with fixed DMG script approach

## ‚úÖ **New Installation Process (Manual)**

### **For Users:**
1. **Drag** "Clipboard Monitor.app" to Applications folder
2. **Run** `install.sh` script
3. **Wait** for prompt about plist files
4. **Copy** both plist files from DMG to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`:
   - `com.clipboardmonitor.plist`
   - `com.clipboardmonitor.menubar.plist`
5. **Press** any key to continue installation
6. **Services** start automatically

### **What Users See:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: SentinelOne security software prevents automated plist creation
üìÅ Plist files are provided in the DMG for manual installation:
   ‚Ä¢ com.clipboardmonitor.plist
   ‚Ä¢ com.clipboardmonitor.menubar.plist

üìã MANUAL INSTALLATION STEPS:

## ‚úÖ **DMG Contents (Restored)**

The DMG now includes:
- ‚úÖ `Clipboard Monitor.app` - Main application
- ‚úÖ `Applications` symlink - For easy installation
- ‚úÖ `install.sh` - Installation script with manual prompts
- ‚úÖ `uninstall.sh` - Uninstallation script
- ‚úÖ `emergency_stop_spawning.sh` - Emergency stop script
- ‚úÖ `com.clipboardmonitor.plist` - Background service configuration
- ‚úÖ `com.clipboardmonitor.menubar.plist` - Menu bar service configuration
- ‚úÖ `README.txt` - Updated installation instructions

## ‚úÖ **Security Compliance**

### **SentinelOne Compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ No automated plist creation (avoids threat detection)
- ‚úÖ Manual file copying by user (user-initiated action)
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of security software requirements
- ‚úÖ Maintains all functionality while being security-compliant

### **Key Benefits:**
1. **Security Compliant**: Works with SentinelOne and similar security software
2. **User Control**: Users manually copy files (transparent process)
3. **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance for users
4. **Maintains Functionality**: All features work as intended
5. **Error Prevention**: Verification checks ensure proper installation

## ‚úÖ **Testing Completed**

- ‚úÖ Syntax validation passed for all scripts
- ‚úÖ DMG creation successful with plist files included
- ‚úÖ Manual installation prompts working correctly
- ‚úÖ Verification checks functioning properly

## ‚úÖ **Status**

**COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

The installation process has been successfully reverted to the manual plist installation approach to ensure compatibility with SentinelOne security software. Users will now manually copy plist files from the DMG, avoiding automated creation that triggers security alerts.

### **Ready for Distribution:**
- New DMG created with plist files included
- Installation script updated with manual prompts
- All verification and safety checks in place
- Security software compatible
