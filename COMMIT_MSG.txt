Fix menu bar app initialization by enabling critical startup components

- Uncomment _build_main_menu() call to construct menu structure
- Enable history update timer initialization 
- Activate status monitoring thread
- Restart app as part of fix verification

This resolves the frozen state and missing menu functionality by restoring:
1. Menu construction
2. Background status checks
3. Clipboard history updates
that were temporarily disabled during debugging.
